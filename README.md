# ComicReader
comicreader exists because its annoying to read the touhou comics
download a release or build one yourself with build.py
you can use comicreader by dragging a folder containing images onto the executable
if you launch the executable it will look for a folder in the same directory called "Book"; if it cant find that folder, it will immidiately  close
this isn't only for touhou
